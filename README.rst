``django-rest-framework-filters`` (formerly ``django-rest-framework-chain``) is an extension to Django REST Framework that makes working with filtering much easier.  In addition to fixing some underlying warts and limitations of ``django-filter``, we allow arbitrary chaining of both relations and lookup filters.

E.g. using ``django-rest-framework-filters`` instead of just ``django-filter``, we can do stuff like::

    /api/page/?author__username__icontains=john
    /api/page/?author__username__endswith=smith

Without having to create a zillion filter fields by hand.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install djangorestframework-filters

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6+
* Django 1.4.5+

Usage
-----

Here's how you were probably doing filtering before:

.. code-block:: python

    import django_filters
    from myapp.models import Product
    
    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        manufacturer = django_filters.CharFilter(name="manufacturer__name")
    
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['category', 'in_stock', 'manufacturer']


To use ``django-rest-framework-filters``, simply import ``rest_framework_filters`` instead of
``django_filters``:

.. code-block:: python

    import rest_framework_filters as filters
    from myapp.models import Product
    
    class ProductFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        manufacturer = filters.CharFilter(name="manufacturer__name")
    
        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['category', 'in_stock', 'manufacturer']

All filters found in ``django-filter`` are available for usage.  In this case, there's nothing new
that's gained.  But read onward!


Chaining filtering through relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable chained filtering through relations:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class UserFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        username = filters.CharFilter(name='username')
        ...

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        title = filters.CharFilter(name='title')
        author = filters.RelatedFilter(UserFilter, name='author')
        ...

    # Then just use the PageFilter as you would any other FilterSet:

    class PageView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        ...
        filter_class = PageFilter

then we can automatically chain our filters through the ``author`` relation, as so::

    /api/page/?author__username=philipn


Allowing any lookup type on a field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use the ``AllLookupsFilter`` to allow all possible lookup types on a particular
field.  While we could otherwise specify these by hand, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class ProductFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        min_price = filters.NumberFilter(name="price", lookup_type='gte')
        ...

to allow the ``price__gte`` lookup.  But this gets cumbersome, and we sometimes want to
allow any possible lookups on particular fields.  We do this by using ``AllLookupsFilter``:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        title = filters.AllLookupsFilter(name='title')
        ...

then we can use any possible lookup on the ``title`` field, e.g.::

    /api/page/?title__icontains=park

or ::

    /api/page/?title__startswith=The

and also filter on the default lookup (``exact``), as usual::

    /api/page/?title=The%20Park

Combining RelatedFilter and AllLookupsFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can combine ``RelatedFilter`` and ``AllLookupsFilter``:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        title = filters.CharFilter(name='title')
        author = filters.RelatedFilter(UserFilter, name='author')

    class UserFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        username = AllLookupsFilter(name='username')
        ...

then we can filter like so::

    /api/page/?author__username__icontains=john

DjangoFilterBackend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We implement our own subclass of ``DjangoFilterBackend``, which you should probably use instead
of the default ``DjangoFilterBackend``.  Our ``DjangoFilterBackend`` caches repeated filter set
generation â€” a particularly important optimization when using ``RelatedFilter`` and ``AllLookupsFilter``.

To use our ``FilterBackend``, in your `settings.py``, simply use:

.. code-block:: python

    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        ...
        'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': (
            'rest_framework_filters.backends.DjangoFilterBackend', ...
        ),

instead of the default ``rest_framework.filters.DjangoFilterBackend``.

What warts are fixed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even if you're not using ``RelatedFilter`` or ``AllLookupsFilter``, you will probably want
to use ``django-rest-framework-filters``.  For instance, if you simply use ``django-filter``
it is very difficult to filter on a ``DateTimeFilter`` in the date format emitted by
the default serializer (ISO 8601), which makes working with your API difficult.

Can I mix and match `django-filter` and `django-rest-framework-filters`?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes you can.  `django-rest-framework-filters` extends `django-filter`, and you can mix and match them as you please.  For a given class, you should use only one of ``django-filter`` or
``django-rest-framework-filters``, but you can use ``RelatedFilter`` to
link to a filter relation defined elsewhere that uses vanilla ``django-filter``.

More information on RelatedFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recursive relations are supported.  You will need to specify the full module
path in the ``RelatedFilter`` definition in some cases, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class PersonFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        name = filters.AllLookupsFilter(name='name')
        best_friend = filters.RelatedFilter('people.views.PersonFilter', name='best_friend')

        class Meta:
            model = Person 

Wanted functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Better support for ``__in=``.
  * Allow for ``OR`` as well as ``AND`` style filtering.
